# Anonfilly
She is best filly. And now, a discord bot!
Some management commands as well as some random commands.
Also an audioplayer that uses yt-dlp to download a song/video, then play it!

## Setup
It's simple!
1. Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/martinshoob/anonfilly-bot.git
```
2. Install the requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Add a .env file with your bot's token
```
echo DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE >> .env
```
4. Modify the files to your liking and run it!
```
python3 anon.py
```

Keep in mind that Anonfilly will only run as long as that command is active, consider setting up a systemd service or just simply using tmux!
